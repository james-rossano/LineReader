# LineReader

Train to read at your maximum potential. Enter a txt file and your desired words per minute for the program to read the contents of that file at the given wpm in a pygame GUI. Inspiration for this project came from the video [How fast can you Read?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQsNMB0b3Nc).

## Example
fileText('filepath', wpm, fontsize <- optional) <br>
`fileRead = readText('BraveNewWorld.txt',250,40)`<br>
`fileRead.readingText()`
